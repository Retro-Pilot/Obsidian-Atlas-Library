# Epistemology MOC

Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of knowledge, its sources, limitations, and validity. It examines questions about how we acquire knowledge, what criteria determine whether a belief is justified or not, and the role of language, culture, and history in shaping our understanding of the world.
